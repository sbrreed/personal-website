          At a certain age in one's life you start to understand more deeply the
          phrase "If you wake up feeling no pain, you're probably dead." For me
          the pain is orthopedic. I seem to be plagued by constant, thankfully
          low level, injuries. Around that same age, there is a marked increase
          in the number of supplements and other treatments recommended and
          marketed to you. I have, generally, been skeptical of these things--
          assuming they are either fad, pseudoscience, or down-right scams. I'm
          a untrusting person, but I also believe in peer-reviewed studies.

          Below is a compilation of supplements and treatments that I've
          researched. My process is generally as such: 1. Ask chatGPT to
          summarize the current research and provide me with references. 2. Read
          one or two of the most recent meta-studies, if available. Meta studies
          are essentially summaries of all the latest research in an area. If
          the information is especially technical or dense, sometimes I like to
          have ChatGPT translate it for me into more understandable language.{" "}

            I read focused on the effects of creatine on cognition and memory.
          </p>

          <p>
            Creatine is a compound that is created in the human body, primarily
            in the liver and brain. It can also be consumed through supplements
            or dietary sources (red-meat & seafood). It is critical to the
            optimal functioning of the brain by helping to maintain levels of
            ATP during energy-demanding cerebral activities, which account for
            about 20% of the body's energy consumption. Creatine reaches the
            brain through the blood brain barrier via a transporter (CT1). Once
            there, brain cells need to create two enzymes that are necessary for
            them to synthesize the creatine. This means that the level of
            creatine in the brain is subject to a number of factors-- not just
            dietary consumption.
          </p>
          <p>
            In multiple studies of varying sizes and types, creatine was shown
            to be helpful to cognitive tasks in a sleep-deprived state. In one,
            it was concluded that "may confer beneficial effects on cognitive
            function in adults, particularly in the domains of memory, attention
            time, and information processing speed". Creatine has also shown
            promise in symptoms of TBI and muscular dystrophy. It has been
            studied in the treatment of depression and anxiety, and the outcomes
            are promising, but more research is needed-especially into whether
            there are sex- and age- related differences in the effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then looked for meta-studies focusing on the effects of creatine
            on physical performance.

            I've had PRP recommended to me twice now, for two different
            injuries. Most recently, for elbow tendinosis (tennis elbow). It's
            not covered by insurance and runs about $800 per treatment. On top
            of that, they say the actual procedure is quite painful, can be sore
            for a week after and then can take months to see the benefit. Those
            reasons combined have, thus far, been enough to turn me away. I
            decided to do some research, however, so see if maybe all that would
            be worth it.

              PRP therapy involves injecting a concentrated solution of the
              patient’s own platelets into the damaged tissue to promote healing
              by stimulating cell growth and reducing inflammation. The
              patient's blood is put in a centrifuge to separate the platelets
              and other growth factors from the other blood components. The
              concentrated blood is then injected directly into the injured
              area. The idea is that the infusion of platelet-derived growth
              factors and other blood elements may be able to stimulate healing
              and reduce inflammation. The body of research is wide but not
              overwhelmingly conclusive. There are a variety of factors involved
              in the procedure that can vary- making meta-analysis comparisons
              difficult. There are multiple ways of preparing and delivering the
              blood. These variables may be significant in the patient
              outcome.PRP has been most studied on elbow injuries (compared to
              other parts of the body).
