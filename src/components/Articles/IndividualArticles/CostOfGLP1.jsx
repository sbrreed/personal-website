          The cost of GLP-1 medications can vary significantly based on the
          specific drug, dosage, and insurance coverage. Here are some general
          insights into the costs associated with these medications:

          <h2>Average monthly cost of a GLP1 medication: $1000</h2>

          <li>
            <strong>Semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy):</strong> The average retail
            price for Ozempic is around $850 per month, while Wegovy can be
            approximately $1,300 per month.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Liraglutide (Victoza, Saxenda):</strong> The cost for
            Victoza is about $800 per month, and Saxenda can be around $1,200
            per month.

            <strong>Exenatide (Bydureon):</strong> The cost is generally around

            What the current reporting on this issue misses is a look into why
            these drugs are so expensive. Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy{" "}

            that sales of the drug hit $2.5bn in the third quarter of 2024. That
            represented a 79% increase compared to the same period in 2023. In
            that same quarter, the company reported a 21% increase in net profit
            ($3.94bn).{" "}

            in JAMA, however, estimates the sustainable cost of the drug to be
            $0.75-$72.49. The economic evaluation study "estimated the cost of
            production for insulins, SGLT2Is, and GLP1As, and, based on this, a
            sustainable cost-based price (CBP), and compared CBPs with the
            current lowest reported prices in 12 countries, collected in January
            2023 from public databases."{" "}

          The Colorado Sun article stated that 3422 state employees were on
          Wegovy last year and 2000 on Ozempic. Were the state to pay even the
          high estimate of what the drug could cost, it could save $5,028,959
          per month.

          What leverage does the state have to pay a lower cost? Not much. Until
          the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, Medicare and
          Medicaid, the largest single payers of prescription drugs in the
          country, were legally bared from negotiating drug prices. With the
          passing of the law, however, Medicaid has included Wegovy and Ozempic
          on it's list of drugs that it will{" "}

          Lawmakers on both sides of this debate should look deeper at the roots
          of the problem. It's possible that prescriptions for these drugs have
          ballooned past what they should be. It's certain, however, that the
          sticker prices have ballooned past what they should be.{" "}
