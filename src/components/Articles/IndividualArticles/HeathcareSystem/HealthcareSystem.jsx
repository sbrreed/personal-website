            Raise your hand if you feel you really understand how our system of
            healthcare and health insurance works? Now put your hand down if
            you're an academic or deep-in-the-crease policy maker. Anyone left?
            Probably not. Our system of delivering and paying for healthcare is
            deeply complicated and opaque. Only those truly passionate about it
            who also have a tolerance for lots of numbers really understand how
            it all works.

            Edward Tufte has spent his entire career trying to get people to
            stop making.

              In this chart Uwe laid out all the players in the drug delivery

              took for internal use (Marketing, Admin and R&D) and profit. Do we
              really need all these middlemen?

              In our healthcare system, we donâ€™t explicitly force people to wait
              for their healthcare. Instead, poorer people in our country are
              forced to make the choice to wait for their healthcare because
              they can't afford it. One system is simply more up-front about the
              situation than the other.
