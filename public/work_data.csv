DataViz,Professional,EPA National Aquatic Resource Survey Dashboard,NARS-Dashboard,The NARS Dashboards are a series of dashboards created to make EPA survey data relating to the aquatic systems within the United States available to the public. ,"Four surveys of the different water types (lakes, rivers, coasts & wetlands) are conducted every five years on a rolling basis. These dashboards allow users to filter the data to the specific information that interests them. The data is presented it in a variety of graphical ways, allowing the EPA to highlight data parameters and comparisons. ","Lead developer for the past 4 years.

DataViz,Professional,Raising Hands Literacty Project Annual Impact Report,RaisingHands,We created a thorough and impactful annual report to allow the organization to better showcase the work they have done to donors and partners.,"I worked closely with Holly, the director of the non-profit, to determine what data and information she had that could communicate the important work that her non-profit does. This was the first annual report she had made, so we spent time consolidating the information and developing a layout that would be both extensive enough to encompass all that they do, but not too long to lose the readers' interest.

The concept behind this project was to create a narrative that was understandable and evocative, while integrating facts and figures related to the topic. We all know that medical care is expensive. By following a fictional couple, this project attempts to get specific about the costs and how they affect real people. To create the fictional couple, I interviewed cancer patients and their partners. I used cartoons to be able to present a dialogue between the couple and the people they interact with throughout the process.",Sole developer,"HTML, JS, D3, CSS, Illustrator",/DataViz/costsOfCancer.png,/DataViz/costsOfCancer.png,Image,http://costsofcancer.com/,,

DataViz,Personal,Colorado's Counties,ColoradoCounties,An infographic looking at population change county by county in Colorado.,"As a transplant to Colorado I’m fascinated by the history of the area which is, in many cases, recent enough to be able to really feel a part of it. The population boom and busts throughout the state have left their marks on the landscape and culture. Populations have migrated around the state following industry- mostly mining, ranching & recreation. This graphic singles out seven distinct counties. Each has experienced its own share of change, but for different reasons. Click on the image to see the whole graphic. It was designed as a large poster, so you'll have to zoom around to read it.",Sole developer,"Tableau, Illustrator",/DataViz/Colorado_thumbnail.png,/DataViz/Colorado_thumbnail.png,Image,/DataViz/Colorado.pdf,,
DataViz,Professional,Traffic Information and Safety Animations,TrafficAnimations,Animated videos created for the Town of Lafayette to help residents understand a new traffic pattern.,"The town of Lafayette CO was preparing to implement a large infrastructure improvement project to their main downtown street. The design of the intersections, parking and more was out dated and reflected a time when the street was a major throughway- before the highway was routed around the town. Included in the plan was the replacement of a stop light with a 4- way stop sign and designated left turn lanes and a sometimes busy intersection. <br>There was concern among the citizens that the change would cause undo delays and safety issues. I was hired to create two short animations explaining the reasoning for making the change and how to use the intersection. The videos were then used in the town's public information campaign as they prepared to start construction.",Sole developer,"D3, Illustrator, Animate",/DataViz/animation2_thumbnail.png,/DataViz/animation2_thumbnail.png,Image,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s81zy8ZAzUk&t=2s&ab_channel=CityofLafayetteColorado,,
DataViz,Personal,Traveling with Children,TravelingWithChildren,An infographic of the emotional ups and downs of travelling with small children.,"We travel with our children fairly often and have since they were infants. When I made this graphic our kids were 9 and 6. Travelling with them has progressively gotten easier but still has it’s challenging moments.<br>For this graphic, my 9 yr old daughter and I logged our actions and emotions every 15 minutes for an entire day of traveling from Louisville, CO to Springfield, MA. We logged from the time we were leaving until the time we arrived. That meant stopping in the middle of security to whip out my notebook and ask her how she was feeling. It meant logging my emotions during the inevitable fight over the iPad. But it also meant logging our emotions over a well deserved Dunkin Donut.<br>In good Feltron style, I also collected other information about our day- number of people we talked with, number of miles travelled, etc.<br>Overall it was a good day but our opposing emotional fluctuations are clear throughout.

DataViz,Personal,Lodz Getto Interactive Prototype,Lodz,Prototype of a potential interactive exhibit for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum,"The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum commissioned my cohort in during my Info Viz program to create prototype designs for an exhibit focused on the Lotz Ghetto. The Lotz Ghetto was one of the first ghettos to be established by the Nazis and contained an enormous population, which was almost entirely wiped out by the end of the war. Detailed records of the people who lived in the Ghetto have been found and it was from this database that we were tasked with creating compelling exhibit prototypes. The project was designed as an ""intensive""- we were given the database in advance but only given 2 days on site in the museum to come up with the prototype.<br>Our concept was an interactive exhibit that would create an emotional experience by illustrating how people were removed from the ghetto. Often, entire families were not removed but, instead, individual members- the old, sick or even the children- leaving gaping holes where they once were. This video contains text explanation of the history of the ghetto as well as illustrations. The people in the video were drawn as a child would draw them in order to invoke the terror a child might feel as people are removed from their family.
